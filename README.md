# **Product Ad Campaign Sales Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust supervised machine learning model designed to accurately forecast key performance indicators (KPIs) for future product ad campaigns. By achieving this goal, the model provides valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall marketing effectiveness.

## **Dataset Information**

The dataset used in this project contains 731 entries and 11 columns related to different factors influencing product sales during ad campaigns. The columns include:

- `limit_infor`: Restrictions associated with the campaign or product (0 or 1).
- `campaign_type`: Type of marketing campaign (e.g., email, social media, print, etc.).
- `campaign_level`: Scale of the campaign (national, regional, or local).
- `product_level`: Category of the product (high-end, mid-range, or budget).
- `resource_amount`: Resources allocated for the campaign (budget, personnel, etc.).
- `email_rate`: Email delivery or open rate.
- `price`: Product selling price.
- `discount_rate`: Discount or promotional offers.
- `hour_resources`: Human resources or hours dedicated to the campaign.
- `campaign_fee`: Fees associated with the campaign.
- `orders`: Number of product orders generated (Target Variable).

## **Objective**

- Build a machine learning model to predict the number of orders generated by future product ad campaigns.
- Use insights from the model to optimize marketing strategy, resource allocation, and overall campaign efficiency.

## **Challenges**

- Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- Feature engineering for effective data transformation.
- Selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm for optimal performance.
- Avoiding overfitting in a relatively small dataset.
- Interpreting the impact of categorical variables on the target variable (`orders`).

## **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Removed missing values and outliers.
   - Used MinMax scaling to normalize numeric features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identified correlations between features and target variable (`orders`).
   - Analyzed the significance of categorical variables using ANOVA.
   
3. **Modeling:**
   - Implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

## **Results**

- Achieved an R-squared score of `X%`, indicating how well the model fits the dataset.
- The most significant factors contributing to `orders` were identified as:
  - `campaign_fee`: Strong positive correlation with orders.
  - `hour_resources`: Positive correlation with orders.
  - `email_rate`: Moderate positive correlation with orders.
  - `discount_rate`: Positive but weaker correlation with orders.

## **Technologies Used**
